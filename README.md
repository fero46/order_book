# Java Matching Engine Demo

This is a simple demo for a matching engine written in Java. The matching engine simulates the matching of buy and sell orders based on limit and market orders.

## Overview

The matching engine is a core component of financial exchanges, responsible for pairing buy and sell orders to facilitate trading. This Java demo provides a basic implementation of a matching engine that handles two types of orders: limit orders and market orders.

- **Limit Order:** A limit order specifies the maximum (for a buy order) or minimum (for a sell order) price at which the order can be executed.

- **Market Order:** A market order is an order to buy or sell a security immediately at the current market price.
